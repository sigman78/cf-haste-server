# Haste

Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be _really_ easy to do it.
A lot of times, I want to show you something I'm seeing - and that's where we use pastebins.

Haste is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin ever made.

## Basic Usage

Type what you want to share, press **Ctrl+S** to save, and then copy the URL. Send that URL
to someone and they'll see exactly what you see.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or press **Ctrl+N**)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+S** - Save your paste
- **Ctrl+N** - Create new paste
- **Ctrl+D** - Duplicate and edit
- **Ctrl+T** - Share on Twitter

## Duration

Pastes are stored for 30 days from their creation date.

## Privacy

There should be no expectation of privacy. Post things at your own risk.
Not responsible for any loss of data or removed pastes.

## Technology

This Haste server runs on Cloudflare's global edge network:

- **Cloudflare Workers** - Serverless compute at 300+ locations worldwide
- **D1 Database** - SQLite database at the edge
- **TypeScript** - Modern, type-safe codebase
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development and builds

## Open Source

Haste can easily be installed behind your network, and it's all open source!
